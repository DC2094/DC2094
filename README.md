- 👋 Hi, I’m @DC2094
- 👀 I’m interested in getting started in contributing to open source projects. I have been working as a dev for 6 and bit years now and feel like I should start giving back to the communitity.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, well just playing around with some tools. I think the next 'big' thing I learn is in the data engineering space. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on large open-source projects in Golang or Python. 
- 📫 How to reach [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dchilds1/ ) works pretty well 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
